PS2EXE

Script to convert powershell scripts to standalone executables

Assuming "ps2exe.ps1" and a scoure script "source.ps1" are in the current directory,
  .\ps2exe.ps1 .\source.ps1 .\target.exe
compiles "source.ps1" into the executable target.exe
(if ".\target.exe" is omitted, output is written to ".\source.exe").

or start Win-PS2EXE for a graphical front end!


Usage:

    ps2exe.ps1 [-inputFile] '<file_name>' [[-outputFile] '<file_name>'] [-prepareDebug]
               [-runtime20|-runtime40] [-lcid <id>] [-x86|-x64] [-STA|-MTA] [-noConsole] [-UNICODEEncoding]
               [-credentialGUI] [-iconFile '<filename>'] [-title '<title>'] [-description '<description>']
               [-company '<company>'] [-product '<product>'] [-copyright '<copyright>'] [-trademark '<trademark>']
               [-version '<version>'] [-configFile] [-noOutput] [-noError] [-noVisualStyles] [-exitOnCancel]
               [-DPIAware] [-winFormsDPIAware] [-requireAdmin] [-supportOS] [-virtualize] [-longPaths]

       inputFile = Powershell script that you want to convert to executable (file has to be UTF8 or UTF16 encoded)
      outputFile = destination executable file name or folder, defaults to inputFile with extension '.exe'
    prepareDebug = create helpful information for debugging
       runtime20 = this switch forces PS2EXE to create a config file for the generated executable that contains the
                   "supported .NET Framework versions" setting for .NET Framework 2.0/3.x for PowerShell 2.0
       runtime40 = this switch forces PS2EXE to create a config file for the generated executable that contains the
                   "supported .NET Framework versions" setting for .NET Framework 4.x for PowerShell 3.0 or higher
      x86 or x64 = compile for 32-bit or 64-bit runtime only
            lcid = location ID for the compiled executable. Current user culture if not specified
      STA or MTA = 'Single Thread Apartment' or 'Multi Thread Apartment' mode
       noConsole = the resulting executable will be a Windows Forms app without a console window
 UNICODEEncoding = encode output as UNICODE in console mode
   credentialGUI = use GUI for prompting credentials in console mode
        iconFile = icon file name for the compiled executable
           title = title information (displayed in details tab of Windows Explorer's properties dialog)
     description = description information (not displayed, but embedded in executable)
         company = company information (not displayed, but embedded in executable)
         product = product information (displayed in details tab of Windows Explorer's properties dialog)
       copyright = copyright information (displayed in details tab of Windows Explorer's properties dialog)
       trademark = trademark information (displayed in details tab of Windows Explorer's properties dialog)
         version = version information (displayed in details tab of Windows Explorer's properties dialog)
      configFile = write config file (<outputfile>.exe.config)
        noOutput = the resulting executable will generate no standard output (includes verbose and information channel)
         noError = the resulting executable will generate no error output (includes warning and debug channel)
  noVisualStyles = disable visual styles for a generated windows GUI application (only with -noConsole)
    exitOnCancel = exits program when Cancel or ""X"" is selected in a Read-Host input box (only with -noConsole)
        DPIAware = if display scaling is activated, GUI controls will be scaled if possible
winFormsDPIAware = if display scaling is activated, WinForms use DPI scaling (requires Windows 10 and .Net 4.7 or up)
    requireAdmin = if UAC is enabled, compiled executable run only in elevated context (UAC dialog appears if required)
       supportOS = use functions of newest Windows versions (execute [Environment]::OSVersion to see the difference)
      virtualize = application virtualization is activated (forcing x86 runtime)
       longPaths = enable long paths ( > 260 characters) if enabled on OS (works only with Windows 10 or up)


A generated executable has the following reserved parameters:

-? [<MODIFIER>]     Powershell help text of the script inside the executable. The optional parameter combination
                    "-? -detailed", "-? -examples" or "-? -full" can be used to get the appropriate help text.
-debug              Forces the executable to be debugged. It calls "System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch()".
-extract:<FILENAME> Extracts the powerShell script inside the executable and saves it as FILENAME.
                    The script will not be executed.
-wait               At the end of the script execution it writes "Hit any key to exit..." and waits for a key to be pressed.
-end                All following options will be passed to the script inside the executable.
                    All preceding options are used by the executable itself and will not be passed to the script.
