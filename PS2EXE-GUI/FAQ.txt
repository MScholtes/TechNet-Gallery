Powershell 7

Hello, since Powershell 7 Final is out now i would like to know if there will be a newer version soon where i can compile my PS7 script?

Hello Jamal1337,

the issue with PS2EXE and PowerShell 6 or 7 is the underlying .Net Core. PS2EXE compiles a frame C# program containing the PowerShell script. .Net Core (and so PowerShell 7) does not deliver a compiler anymore in its base installation, one has to install the SDK to get one ("Roslyn").

And once there is the compiler, the calling method has changed completely. I do not know how to implement this without weeks of work.

If someone has a good idea how to make it "cheap", please tell.

Hello AW L,

beginning with Powershell V3 Microsoft made a weird implementation of Start-Transscript with mixing the code into the Powershell and the underlying host. So I did not implement this commandlet and have no plans to do so.

Sorry for that.

Hallo Markus,



danke erstmal für dieses hilfreiche und nützliche Tool.



Ich habe ein Skript mit Buttons und Progressbar. Wenn ich dieses Mittels ps2exe konvertiere, sind die Buttons nicht mehr "highlighted" und die Progressbar sieht auch anders aus, als wenn ich das Skript einfach so ausführe. Ich habe diese Frage bereits im Microsoft Technet gestellt, dort hatte man zwar Ideen, aber letztendlich hat man mich hierher verwiesen. Da ich hier keine Funktion zum Einfügen von Bildern gefunden habe, hinterlasse ich hier mal einen Link aus dem Forum, da ich dort 2 Beispiele in Bildform angehängt habe. https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/de-DE/a05c6a1a-eae4-4add-a6c7-43cd43d403c9/nach-erstellung-einer-exe-mit-ps2exe-keine-highlighted-buttons?forum=powershell_de



Was kann ich tun, damit die Buttons und die Progressbar so aussehen, wie sie in Bild 1, also bei Ausführung des Skriptes, aussehen?



Vielen Dank.

Running EXE as another user

nickp85
Hello,



This little program is great for handing completed PS scripts to helpdesk folks without having to explain how to launch PS and run the script.  I have noticed though that if I run the EXE using shift+right click > run as different user, when the PS script has completed, the process is not exiting.  It stays in task manager until I kill it.  Does not seem to happen if I just double click the file.



Any way to fix this so the process closes as expected when done?

Geschrieben Januar 27, 2020
Markus Scholtes
Hello nickp85,

this sounds a bit complicated. I think there is an issue with using PoshRSJob in PS2EXE. PoshRSJob starts a powershell runspace pool without closing it. Powershell.exe forcefully closes all runspaces on exit, but PS2EXE is running in a runspace by itself. So it waits for the runspaces to close what never happens, this leads to an infinite wait.

I found no easy way to tell PoshRSJob to close its runspaces, so I see two workarounds:

1. Change the runspaces of PoshRSJob to use its own threads

Search for the file Start-RSJob.ps1 in the module directory of PoshRSJob, if installed for the AllUsers context the path is "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\poshrsjob\1.7.4.4\Public\Start-RSJob.ps1".

Edit the file and insert the line
  $RunspacePool.ThreadOptions = "UseNewThread"
in the line before
  $RunspacePool.Open()
(line 524 as of version 1.7.4.4)

Since PoshRSJob runspaces use their own threads now they can be distinguished from PS2EXE's runspace and get closed on exit.

If you want the runspaces to close faster at the end replace
  $RunspacePool.CleanupInterval = [timespan]::FromMinutes(2)
with something like
  $RunspacePool.CleanupInterval = [timespan]::FromSeconds(10)
two lines before the expression mentioned above.


2. Close the runspaces manually on exit of your script

Put the following line on all places of your script where an exit can occur:

Get-Runspace | ?{ $_.Id -ne [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Runspace]::DefaultRunspace } | ?{ $_.RunspaceAvailability -lt 3 } | %{ $_.Dispose() }

This line closes all runspaces that are not "Busy" and obviously not the default runspace (you would crash the script engine then). I would not recommend to do this in regular scripts.

Hope this helps.

Can't run exe created in Win10 on Win7 Machine

I have a script that I would like to package using PS2EXE and be able to run it on Win7 or Win10 without a config file. All computers I will run it on will have .NET4 so I would like to be able to specify the requirements as Powershell2 and .NET4.



Currently if I build the exe on Win7, I can run it on win10 but I get a prompt to install .NET2/3.5. If I use a config file with .Net4 specified it will run fine on Win10 without installing .NET2/3.5 but I would prefer not to have to distribute a config file with the exe.



If I build the exe on Win10 and try to run it on win7 I get an error that the program has stopped working and I see the following error in the console.



Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Management.Automation, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. at ik.Powershell.PS2EXE.Main(String[] args)



Is there a way to specify requirements as Powershell2 and .NET4 so it will run on win7 or win10 running .NET4?

Geschrieben November 13, 2019

Hello KMarryat,

when I understand your environment correctly you try to do something that cannot function:
- PowerShell Version 2 works only with .Net 2 or .Net 3 and NOT with .Net 4
- PowerShell Version 3 or up is NOT included in .Net 4

You have two choices when you want to use one binary:
- install .Net 3 on Windows 10 and use PowerShell V2 there with a config file that enforces PowerShell 2
- install WMF 5.1 on Windows 7 so you can use PowerShell V5.1 there with a config file that enforces PowerShell 5.1

Support for german Umlaute (special cases)

Hello Markus,



thank you for overworking and maintaining this project, very much appreciated.



Im using ps2exe for converting a powershell script with a gui to a standalone .exe. The GUI is build with System.Windows.Forms-elements, so nothing out of the ordinary.



However, after compiling to an .exe-File german special cases / "Umlaute" like äöüß are not displayed correctly anymore. Instead, these characters are displayed like "?".



It seems like there is a change of encoding going on in the encapsulating process and the new charset does not support these characters.



Are these special characters supported?

Hello Jakob,

PS2EXE can handle special characters like Umlauts  but expects the source file to be UTF8 oder Unicode encoded. Please convert your source file before compiling, for example with

  gc .\sourceASCII.ps1 | sc sourceUTF8.ps1 -Encoding UTF8

Encoding

A.F.Alves
Hello!



Would it be possible to add an option to change the encoding? I see that you set the encoding to UTF8, but in scripts that use Active Directory fields (ANSI) this causes errors in filenames and things like that. I have solved this problem by replacing all "UTF8" with "Default" in your script, but it would be nice to have an option to choose the desired encoding in the GUI or even through command line.



Thank you!

Geschrieben September 27, 2019
Markus Scholtes
Hello A.F. Alves,

without investigating this topic, wouldn't it be the better way you convert or create your scripts in UTF8 or UNICODE Format. I think this would be much better because I guess those scripts would work independent of the localized character set of the computer.
This was the reason for me to choose UTF8 as encoding since it "understands" UTF8 and UNICODE and is not langauge dependend.

Hello EmilSkibsted,

I guess the "blinking window" is the Shell that opens when you run your command. You have two options:

2. Compile with the Option -noConsole

Hello EmilSkibsted,

I understand now. When loading modules or assemblies, PowerShell shows a progress bar (you may not notice it because it's shown for a short time only). When compiling with PS2EXE and -noConsole to a graphical executable, the progress bar obviously is shown in a window: your "blinking window".

Please set the following command to the beginning of your script to prevent progress bars:
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'

To reenable progress bars use
$ProgressPreference = 'Continue'

Hello iRoger,

Hi there, is there a way to protect the .exe against a decompile backup to ps1 so I can protect the sourcecode of the software?

Geschrieben September 12, 2019
Markus Scholtes
Hello Stefan071,

this makes not really sense since PS2EXE encodes and not encrypts the source script.
But you may open ps2exe.ps1 with a (good) text editor and replace the expression
  s.StartsWith("-extract", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)
with
  false

Any script you compile afterwards is not decodable with a command line parameter, but still is decodable with a hex editor (and a lot of knowledge).

Greetings

Thank you very much Markus. When you have a bit of your IP in the PS code it is really handy to know you are able to stop decompile. I know it's not 100% safe but it's a lot better than having it be super easy to get to the source and whatever.
So thank you!

"Start-Process [process] -Wait" doesn't work on Windows 7

I used this tool to create an executable from a PowerShell script on my laptop (running Windows 10 64-bit, v1903). It worked great, I selected the options for run as admin as well as "noConsole" and tested on a couple Windows 10 machines.



However, when I tested on a Windows 7 laptop I noticed that the "-Wait" flag wasn't respected (the commands executed fine, but didn't wait which caused issues with my verification logic).



Is this a known issue? Is there a workaround?

Geschrieben September 06, 2019
Markus Scholtes
Hello Jeffrey McClain,

I guess this is a misunderstanding. When you compile a script with the option -NoConsole, a graphical program is generated. The shell does not wait for a graphical program to exit.

You have to use start /wait (if started from cmd.exe) or Start-Process -Wait (from PowerShell) to instruct the shell to wait.

Passing arguement

Abby Potter
Hi Markus, I used PS2exe for converting .ps1 file. My ps1 file takes 2 arguments during installation. ie, .\my.ps1 "arg1","arg2". arg1 is used by an exe for installation. When I run from ps1, the exe takes arg1 as per the required logic but when I run ps2exe converted exe it takes both the arguments(arg1 and arg2)as input parameter which is causing issue. I verified the same by running process explorer. It would be very kind of you if you could help me.

Geschrieben August 08, 2019
Markus Scholtes
Hello Abby Potter,

I can explain this behaviour, but can not do anything about it because it's not under PS2EXE's control. When you pass "arg1","arg2" to a PowerShell script, an Array is passed to the script. If you pass "arg1","arg2" to an executable, the shell passes a string to the executable. So the string with the value "arg1","arg2" is the first parameter.

Is it possible for you to set a blank after the comma? Could you omit the comma? This might work.

Greetings

Add a parameter "-noNamedParams" to ps2exe.ps1
5 Posts | Letzter Beitrag Juni 30, 2019

Geschrieben Juni 25, 2019
obrain17
I created an enhancement for ps2exe:



-noNamedParams = disable interpreting parameters in powershell style, means arguments will be passed directly



If this parameter is set the part for "{ // parameter in powershell style" is commented, means "named parameter found" will be ignored, means all parameters will be handled as "unnamed" and passed directly to the original .ps code. This means especially that not $True or $False processing is done.

The purpose is mainly if you want to call an external .exe or .cmd (e.g. with Start-Process  -ArgumentList …) that cannot deal with the powershell style parameters and you might pass the original parameters directly.



Unfortunately I cannot upload my contribution because I am getting the message:



"Sorry, you don't have privilege to upload a sample."

Markus Scholtes
Hello obrain17,

I have to admit I don't really understand your question.
What is "argument passed directly"? PS2EXE is calling a Powershell script, so obviously there is no "direct" passing of parameters but always a "passing to Powershell".
Why don't you set your parameters in quotes to pass them unchanged?

Greetings

Markus

Geschrieben Juni 27, 2019
obrain17
Hello Markus,

I do not call the program myself. In this case of course I could adapt the arguments, set them in quotes .etc..

The purpose of the "-noNamedParams" option is when you want to write kind of a hook-program or replacement = an exe file that has the same  name of an already exiting one. It gets called, then does this and that, and afterwards it may call the original .exe passing the original arguments unchanged.

Even if I only write a .ps1 that displays the $args on the console, this .ps1 will show them all correctly but a "ps2exe" compiled .exe would show $True" for empty arguments, remove some ":" from pathname, etc.

But with my new "-noNamedParams" switch the .exe will behave exactly as the .ps1.

Best regards,
Rainer

Hello obrain17,

I understand now. But I guess I will not implement this feature for two reasons. First the executables generated by PS2EXE shall behave as closest as possible like the original script. This switch would prevent this. Second, your request seems to be a very special request. I may change my mind if there are other people requesting this.

Hello Markus,

You are right, it is a very special request. For me it worked perfectly, but I understand I might be the only one needing this. And I already have it :-)

As a last info for those who might been interested, here a part of a .ps1 script hat is making use of the feature of passing the parameters directly to another program:

foreach($u in $Args)
{
  $v=[string]$u
  $prm += $v + ' '
}

$process = Start-Process -Filepath $proc -ArgumentList $prm

Hello Romeo Montague,

I guess it has nothing to do with PS2EXE but with the buffer settings of your command prompt (cmd.exe).
To check this start a command prompt, open the menu (maybe with a right click on the title bar) and select "Defaults". Go to the tab "Layout" and check if the value for "Height" in the section "Screen Buffer size" is high enough to allow scrolling.

Would it be possible to enable this option through the script somehow?

Hello Romeo Montague,

Hello StefanBPS,

you have some non-ASCII apostrophs in your scripts like “Name : ”,“” (copy-and-paste-error form Word or a webbrowser?).
PowerShell is nice if they appear in an ANSI encoded file, but PS2EXE converts the script internally to UNICODE. So you get an error then.

Please replace the wrong apostrophs with the correct ones: ' or ". Then everything will be fine.

Markus, that helped a lot, thank you.
Could it be that I can't load the Veeam snapin for Powershell.

This is my code:
\\

Add-PSSnapin VeeamPSSnapin

if( -not $?)
{
Write-Output "$(Get-TimeStamp) restorevm function : error loading the the Veeam powershell snapin" | Out-file $tracefile -append
mailandcleanup
}
\\

And my trace files shows that the it's giving an error on the RC so it starts the mailandcleanup function.
Is this a possible limitation of the PS2EXE? I felt like I was so close to having it work! :)

I understand, maybe you have an idea what the problem could be.
I have this powershell script that I would really like to compile to .exe, it works fine in powershell and restores a VM, it doesn't work after it is compiled.


Veeam needs some variables to be filled before the restore can start:

$datastore = Find-VBRViDatastore -Server $abchost -Name ($abcdatastore)
$resourcepool = Find-VBRViResourcePool -Server "$abchost" -Name "$abcresourcepool"
$restorepoint = Get-VBRRestorePoint -Backup $job -Name $line | Select -Last 1

This is what's in the variables at my test run with Powershell (I did a write-host)

restorepoint is Veeam.Backup.Core.COib
server is esx01.demo.local
resourcepool is Veeam.Backup.Core.Infrastructure.CViResourcePoolItem
datastore is STORE12_cpty_vol02_V3700demo
vmname is Vyos05-abctmp
<restore starts and works fine>

This is what's in the variables at my test run with the compiled .exe (write-host again)

restorepoint is Veeam.Backup.Core.COib
server is esx01.demo.local
resourcepool is Veeam.Backup.Core.Infrastructure.CViResourcePoolItem
datastore is STORE12_cpty_vol02_V3700demo
vmname is Vyos05-abctmp
<restore error as seen below>

but the restore command gives this error:

ERROR: Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'Veeam.Backup.Core.Infrastructure.CViDatastoreItem' required by parameter 'Datastore'. Specified method is not supported.


Used restore command:

restore command: Start-VBRRestoreVM –RestorePoint $restorepoint –Server $abchost -Resourcepool $resourcepool –Datastore $datastore -VMName "$line-abctmp" | Tee-Object -FilePath "c:\abc\logs\$line-vmrestorecommandoutput.log" -append

Any help would be great, if not that's ok.

The problem seems to be the type of variables passed tot he Start-VBRRestoreVM command. Powershell has no problems with these and executes the restore but once you compile the powershell script it comes with the "ERROR: Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'Veeam.Backup.Core.Infrastructure.CViDatastoreItem' required by parameter 'Datastore'. Specified method is not supported." error.

I can't seem to work around this problem yet.

Hello StefanBPS,

seems to me a similiar problem like the "apostroph issue". In the command line with Start-uVBRRestoreVM there are some "EN DASH" characters (ASCII code 0x96) instead of the regular "hyphen minus" (ASCII code 0x2d). Please copy the "minus" from –Datastore to the clipboard and use it to replace it with a correct minus.

Did you copy commands from MS Word, this character is used there as a optional hyphen?

I'm getting an compilation error :



Could not create the PowerShell .exe file because of compilation errors. Use -verbose parameter to see details.

COMMENTAIRES : error CS0013: Erreur inattendue lors de l'écriture des métadonnées dans le fichier 'd:\PS2EXEGUI\EXE\MyExe.exe' -- 'Pas d'espace logique restant pour la création de chaînes utilisateur supplémentaires.'



I investigated, and it's due to some binaries integrated in my script by converted Base64 strings (picture, pdf, ...). Whatever the Base64 string, it looks like it has some limitation. There are about ten Base64 strings in my script for binaries sized 70ko up to 2Mo. And my script is sized 6200Ko, and about 16Mo once compiled.



I found more information here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ef/performance-considerations#strategies-for-improving-performance

It's talking about the size limit with large and complex models. But I don't know how to do.

Hello AG_G1,

you have a similiar problem that jackofalltech has (see question "Over Come 16777214" below), a string in C# is limited to a size of 16 MByte. Since PS2EXE-GUI compiles to C# and the PS1 script is held in a string variable in C#, this is a fixed limit!

C# is storing ist strings UTF16 encoded, so the size of your script will be doubled. Additionally it is converted to a base64 string which leads to a another growth in size of 33 percent. This is the reason why your script raises from 6 MByte to over 16 MByte when compiled.

I thought about it, but I found no way to get along with it. It is a hard limit. Please try to build smaller scripts.

Hello papamanman,

I'm sorry to say that this cannot work. PS2EXE compiles scripts to real executables, and all executables have only access to parameters of the type string! Parameters of a complex type like HashTable can only be passed to Commandlets or PowerShell functions.
In your case your HashTable is implicitly converted to a string so the compiled script only gets the string "System.Collections.Hashtable" as parameter.

There is nothing I can do about this since this is a limitation of the shell.

That is what the -NoConsole switch will do if you want to hid the error message add -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue or | out-null to the command that is throwing the error

Hello BFrisan,

this behaviour is by design.

You have to search for the command that generates the error and fix the error or prevent the error message by using the "-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue" option or by redirecting the error output like this (example is Get-ChildItem  for a not existing file):

Get-ChildItem NotexistingFile 2> $NULL

Hello AG_G1,

when running your code in a compiled script, there is no window handle because you didn't created one. Please try the following code to use the parent process' window:
...
$handle = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetCurrentProcess().MainWindowHandle
if ($handle -eq 0) { $handle = (Get-Process -PID ((Get-WMIObject -Class Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessID=$PID").ParentProcessId)).MainWindowHandle }
$object = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application
…

Another problem that can occur is an issue with MTA and COM (should occur only when using PowerShell V2) that leads to freezing windows. If this is your problem try to compile your script with the additional Parameter -STA

I wrote a script that is displaying it's own two forms. If I run the script in Powershell ise everything works like expected, no output is written into the console.

Using a screen shot program I discovered, that it is an empty window with the title progress. I am not using ANY progress related function.

Thanks for this great utility. It is working marvellously.

Hello Stefan,

it took me some time and brain to investigate this!

There is a continuing bug or better said leak in the script of Foxdeploy's blog. Runspaces are opened but never closed.
Powershell.exe closes those runspaces forcefully, PS2EXE waits (infinitely) for them to close. To see what I mean start the example from Foxdeploy with
powershell.exe <PATH>\Powershell_GUI_Template.ps1
(please provide the correct <PATH>)

There are two ways to correct this

1. Remove all appearances of
  $newRunspace.ThreadOptions = "ReuseThread"
With this change PS2EXE will close runspaces forcefully.

2. Correctly close the runspaces after use
This is more complicated, for the example "Powershell_GUI_Template.ps1" on Foxdeploy you have to insert
	$runspace.Powershell.Runspace.Close()
after line 82 (= $runspace.powershell.dispose())

Change line 169
  $jobCleanup.PowerShell.Dispose()
to the three lines
  $jobCleanup.PowerShell.EndInvoke($jobCleanup.Thread)
  $jobCleanup.PowerShell.Dispose()
  $jobCleanup.PowerShell.Runspace.Close()

Append
  $psCmd.EndInvoke($data)
  $psCmd.Dispose()
  $psCmd.Runspace.Close()
at the end after
  $data = $psCmd.BeginInvoke()

(there is still a "runspace leak" left when closing the window while Update-Window is working, you have to fix it yourself)

Hello MKz991,

as in powershell.exe there is no automatic return of the last exit code in PS2EXE to the calling shell. According to powershell scripts you have to use
  exit $LASTEXITCODE
as last command in your script to accomplish this.

Hello Markus.

You can test this behavior by compiling 2 examples code's line below:

Example with CMDlets (compiling with -NoConsole):
$Null = Invoke-WebRequest -uri "http://example.com/" -disableKeepAlive

Example with CMD commands (compiling with -NoConsole -RequireAdmin):

Geschrieben Juli 15, 2018

Hello Minh Cu?ng,

Invoke-WebRequest shows a progress bar, which is displayed in a new window in -noConsole mode. If you don't want this window, disable displaying of progress bars with:

$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
$Null = Invoke-WebRequest -uri "http://example.com/" -disableKeepAlive
$ProgressPreference = 'Continue'

mountvol.exe needs a command shell to run so it starts its own if there is no shell present. This is the window that appears for a very short time. The solution is to start mountvol.exe (and its shell) hidden:

$Null = Start-Process mountvol.exe -ArgumentList 'x:','/s' -WindowStyle Hidden

I have written a script that will be used on alot of servers and everytime someone logs on it should run. Now to do that I need an .exe file. When I used your script to convert my script into a .exe file, it has 7 popup windows where the first one has "0" and the second one has "1" all the way to 6. Then an error pops up saying "It is not possible, to invoke a method for an expression, which is NULL" (translated from german, might not be 1-1 but tried my best translating it).

Now after this error my script finally pops up. But when I close it, I again get a popup window saying "Cancel" or "OK".

Now what might be the problem is, that I programmed my own GUI in my powershell script, but I am not the expert of what this script does.

Is there a way to block these popup messages or another workaround? I would be thankful for your help.



Thanks in advance

For clarity, I mean your script here, otherwise it would be quite confusing

Hello Crowlex,

the PS2EXE Parameter "-noConsole" does not mean that there is no output, the output will be presented in message boxes.

When you want to get rid of the Output you have to find the commands in your script (maybe in executing the script in ps1 form) that generate output and suppress it.

You can do this by piping to Out-Null, e.g.
Get-Process | Out-Null

The Cancel or OK at the end of the script is the result of your GUI window. Find the expression that calls .Show() or .ShowDialog() and suppress the output with the [VOID] type, e.g.

[VOID]$Form.ShowDialog()

How to suppress all of the GUI boxes that pop up after enabling noconsole?

I add the -noconsole switch to ps2exe but because my script has 15 actions it is performing, it displays that dialog box 15 times which is not what the users would want to see or keep clicking. Is there anyway I can disable that GUI output too while hiding the console? Thanks.

Hello Raviolikant,

I'm sorry there seems to be kind of misunderstanding. -noConsole meens no console output but it does not mean no output at all.

You have two choices to work around:
1. Capture each output in your script:
You can does this in different ways, maybe by piping to Out-Null

(Senseless) Example:
Get-ChildItem | Out-Null

2. Compile without the parameter -noConsole and hide the console window in your script:

Include the following lines at the start of your script

###############################################################
Add-Type -Name WinAPI -Namespace Native -MemberDefinition '
[DllImport("Kernel32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr GetConsoleWindow();

[DllImport("user32.dll")]
public static extern bool ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 nCmdShow);
'

function Show-Console
{
	$ConsoleHandle = [Native.WinAPI]::GetConsoleWindow()
	[Native.WinAPI]::ShowWindow($ConsoleHandle, 5) | Out-Null
}

function Hide-Console
{
	$ConsoleHandle = [Native.WinAPI]::GetConsoleWindow()
	[Native.WinAPI]::ShowWindow($ConsoleHandle, 0) | Out-Null
}
###############################################################

After that you can call
Hide-Console
to hide your console window and
Show-Console
to show the console again

Hello Markus,



I used your script many times (thanks for it), but I can't use it for my last script and I can't find my problem, I hope you will be able to help me.



So it's simple script to manage group membership of AD users. I'm using Windows form,  and this script is 90% similar to all my others scripts.



I think there is only one difference, one of my function export list in txt file on my C: and in other function i use "Get-Content" command to read this file and display it in ListBox.

So if i execute my script from ISE, it works but if convert it in EXE file with PS2EXE, when I start EXE file I have .NET error :

Hello Florian,

it is really hard to tell what is going wrong with your script. Maybe you have to compile it with the -STA parameter?

If this does not help, I Need more information. What OS and Powershell version you are using (while compiling the script and while using the compiled binary). When does the error occur? What is your script doing?

Greetings

So, with "-STA" it's working :)))))))

What is this option for ?

Geschrieben März 30, 2018
Markus Scholtes
Hello Florian,

fine it's working now.

STA stands for Single Thread Apartment as opposed to MTA (Multi Thread Apartment).
When compiling with -STA the whole process works in one thread.
The problems you were facing have nothing to do with PS2EXE, Powershell or .Net, it is a COM issue. When calling some Windows file dialog controls in the background COM calls are made which only work in STA mode.
STA mode is default for Powershell V3 or above, Powershell V2 is using MTA as default. So I guess you are using Powershell V2.

Greetings

Hello Markus,

OK thank you for these explications !!

It's PS V4 that's running on my server, but it works with -STA, so I will not try to find why it's not STA mode by default on my server ... !

At First thx for this great Tool!



i converted my PS1 with XAML WPF GUI and almost everything works, only on close of the Application i get an Error Message "False" with an "OK" Button.



How can i disable this message?



thx for any help.

Geschrieben März 07, 2018
Markus Scholtes
Hello benzu,

when you compile a script with the option "-noConsole", every output is displayed in a messagebox.

I have a guess what the reason for this is in your script:

You start the WPF window somewhere in your script with a command similiar to this (the name of the variable $Window may vary):

$Window.Showdialog()

You have to change it to

[VOID]$Window.Showdialog()

as the command returns the text "false" which is then displayed in a message box. [VOID] "eats" everything returned, so "false" is not displayed anymore.

Greetings

EnableVisualStyles not working anymore with Forms

Been a While that I dont get a new version of ps2exe. I use version 5.0.0 on a Windows 7 and my script with forms can use the "[System.Windows.Forms.Application]::EnableVisualStyles()" expression and get the right style after getting the EXE version.



But I tried with the latest version (1/4/2018) and its just broken, the style just dont work anymore. Tried the ps2exe at the same Windows 7 and on a Windows 10.



Think this will get fixed? Thanks.

Hello Lemys,

I created a small WinForms program with a style and compiled it with PS2EXE. It works just fine with Windows 7 and with Windows 10, the style is shown when run as script and is shown when compiled with PS2EXE.

Are you sure styles are activated in your OS. Maybe your selected style is not available? Is there an error message or other strange behaviour?

Hi Markus!

Thanks for the reply.

I just enable the style right before showing the form:

[System.Windows.Forms.Application]::EnableVisualStyles()
[void]$Form.ShowDialog()

There are no errors apearing.

I noticed that also a "progress" screen keeps poping up as well when I run a job or import a module. Dunno if thats just something I can disable.

Posted a video to show what happens.

First was made with version 5.0.0 second one with 5.0.9 same script no changes.

Hello Lemys,

the easy answer first. PS2EXE now shows a progress bar in situations a script would do that when compiled with "-noConsole", the progress bar is displayed in a GUI window. You disable this (default) behaviour with the following line (also in "normal" powershell scripts):
$ProgressPreference = "SilentlyContinue"

Now to your main question. According to your video I guess you have troubles with the style of the progress bar. The rest of the form seems okay to me. Can you post the code that creates the progress bar object and sample code that displays the bar so I can check this?

Greetings

Thanks for the "$ProgressPreference" explanation, had no idea. To remove all those little progress bar windows I had to put it in 4 diferent places in my script. Damn M$.

About the progressbar:
- Adds the bar:
$ProgressBar = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar
$ProgressBar.Location = new-object System.Drawing.point(15,55)
$ProgressBar.size = new-object System.Drawing.Size(0,10)
$ProgressBar.Minimum = $ProgressBar.Maximum = $ProgressBar.Value = 0
$Form.Controls.Add($ProgressBar)

- When I need to remove it
$ProgressBar.size = new-object System.Drawing.Size(0,10)
$Form.Controls.Remove($Form.Controls["ProgressBar"])

- When I need to reset it
$ProgressBar.Value = 0

- To increment it
$ProgressBar.Value += 1

Thanks

o.O

Strangely, after I set the "$ProgressPreference = "SilentlyContinue" before all the commands that made the "progress window" apear, the Style of the window started to work.

The Progress Bar also got the right style.

Se everything is working as expected now. Thanks e lot!

Hello Lemys,

now I have an idea what was going wrong in your script. According to Microsoft: "To have an effect, System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles must be called before creating any controls in the application".

When loading any modules in PS2EXE, progress controls are generated and the calling of EnableVisualStyles() will have no effect afterwards.

I will check if I can call EnableVisualStyles() in PS2EXE before executing the script when compiled with -noConsole.

How can I avoid all kinds of pop-ups in noconsole mode. I don't want pop-ups with -1 and other output like disk size when mounting VHD etc., When I try with PS2EXE without GUI its not working with No console option. Thanks in advance.

Geschrieben November 21, 2017
Markus Scholtes
Hello vvkprasad,

since PS2EXE presents a message box for every output when used with the parameter -noConsole, this can be very annoying.

To get rid of this you have to suppress the output of the commands you don't need. To do this, you might redirect the output, for example change a command
cmdlet-withoutput
to
cmdlet-withoutput | Out-Null

But you have to identify the commands with unneeded output by yourself.

Add resource to exe

Dear Markus,



Thank you for this cool tool.

I have created a script which contains forms, and put the company logo ("logo.ico") to this form.

$Form.Icon = New-Object system.drawing.icon("logo.ico")

When this file is not located in the folder, I got error message.

Is it possible to add this resource to the .exe file when compiles?

Regards,

Krisztian


Geschrieben August 09, 2017
Markus Scholtes
Hello SagiK,

there is no possibility to embed the icon with PS2EXE. You have to embed it to the powershell source file.

To do this you might do the following:

1. Create a base64 string out of your icon:

[CONVERT]::ToBase64String((Get-Content "logo.ico" -Encoding BYTE))

Copy the resulting string to the clipboard

2. Insert the following lines to your script:

Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework

$Base64Text = 'REPLACE_WITH_BASE64TEXT'
$BITMAP = New-Object System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapImage
$BITMAP.BeginInit()
$BITMAP.StreamSource = [System.IO.MemoryStream][System.Convert]::FromBase64String($Base64Text)
$BITMAP.EndInit()
$BITMAP.Freeze()

# Convert the bitmap into an icon
$IMAGE = [System.Drawing.Bitmap][System.Drawing.Image]::FromStream($BITMAP.StreamSource)
$Form.Icon = [System.Drawing.Icon]::FromHandle($IMAGE.GetHicon())

3. Replace REPLACE_WITH_BASE64TEXT with the copied base64 string

This should work as powershell script and as compiled executable with PS2EXE.

Markus Scholtes
Hello xja88,

with your question for Start-Transcript you really gave me a very difficult task.

Microsoft did not document the transcript function so I had to check by myself:
Powershell 2: transcripts are implemented in the powershell host (powershell.exe)
Powershell 3: transcripts are implemented in the powershell host (powershell.exe)
Powershell 4: transcripts are implemented in the commandlets Start-Transcript, Out-Default and Stop-Transcript
Powershell 5: transcripts are implemented in the commandlets Start-Transcript, Out-Default and Stop-Transcript
Powershell 6 (Beta): in the source code transcripts are implemented in the powershell host (powershell.exe)

Because of this situation I do not see a possibility to help you, the risk of getting incompatible is to high for me.

If you are using Powershell 4 or 5 there is a workaround:
Pipe ervery command you want to be logged to Out-Default (e.g, Get-ChildItem | Out-Default).

Or insert the following command in the line before the expression powershell.AddCommand("out-string") in PS2EXE.PS1:
  powershell.AddCommand("out-default");

I'm sorry I can't do more for you.

Hello Markus,



i converted a script to exe but after conversion i get an error that its unable to find type [System.Windows.Messagebox]. When i run the script in Powershell ISE it runs without problems.

a piece of the code is:

Function Resetpassword {



    IF ($objPasswordBox.text -eq $objPassword2Box.Text) {

    Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "$User" -Reset -NewPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "$Password1" -Force)

    IF ($objCheckChangePasswordAtLogon.Checked -eq $true) {

    Set-ADUser -Identity "$User" -ChangePasswordAtLogon $True

    }

    [System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show('Het wachtwoord is aangepast.')

    IF ($objPasswordBox.text -ne $objPassword2Box.Text) {

    }

    $objPasswordBox.clear()

    $objPassword2Box.clear()

}



I'm totally new to this and have no idea how fix this. I googled and found to add [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Windows.Forms") or Add-Type –AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms to the script, but both didn't work.
