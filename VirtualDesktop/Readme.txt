Remarks:
For a C# implementation look here: https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop

The API is not or rarely documented by Microsoft. So there is a risk Microsoft
changes the API with an os update and this script will then not work anymore
(Microsoft did so already with anniversary update, 1803, 1809, Server 2022 and Windows 11).
